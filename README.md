# ClimateOS

ClimateOS is a modular platform for planning, simulating, and operating climate resilience programs. The v0 skeleton focuses on documentation and interface contracts so policy designers, modelers, and implementers can collaborate before heavy engineering begins.

## Repo Layout

- `docs/` — strategy briefs, playbooks, and design references
- `packages/` — reusable libraries for data ingest, modeling, and orchestration
- `services/` — API surfaces for metrics, interventions, and reporting
- `infra/` — IaC, deployment scripts, and observability plumbing

## Early Objectives

1. Capture the ClimateOS “north star” charter
2. Define interfaces for data providers, intervention planners, and reporting clients
3. Stand up a stub API that echoes scenario submissions
4. Publish the first pilot playbook (community cooling, energy, or water)

🚧 Everything is alpha. Most directories only contain scaffolding until the workstreams spin up.
