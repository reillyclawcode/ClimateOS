# ClimateOS Infra Notes

Initial checklist:

- Choose base cloud (GCP/AWS) and region strategy
- Define env topologies (dev, staging, pilot)
- Provision observability stack (logs, traces, metrics)
- Capture secrets + key management plan

Everything here is scaffolding until we pick a deployment target.
