# ClimateOS Core Package (Placeholder)

This package will host cross-cutting utilities:

- Data source definitions & schemas
- Scenario + intervention typing
- Shared math helpers (timeseries, cost models, carbon accounting)
- Messaging/event contracts between services

For now, this README marks the intent so we can structure future work. Add a proper build system (TypeScript/ Rust / Python) once we lock scope.
