# ClimateOS Charter (Draft)

## Mission
Build an OS-level toolkit for climate resilience programs. ClimateOS packages guidance, models, and operating playbooks so local teams can move from policy to deployment with tight feedback loops.

## Guiding Principles
- **Interoperability first.** Prefer open data standards and API-first interfaces.
- **Measurable impact.** Pair every intervention with metrics, baselines, and verification pathways.
- **Local-first UX.** Tools should adapt to city, tribal, and regional contexts with minimal forked code.
- **Human + model collaboration.** Keep climate planners in the loop with explainable modeling and simple overrides.

## Workstreams (2026 H1)
1. **Data Platform** – catalog climate, infrastructure, and socio-economic data sources; ship ingestion SDKs.
2. **Model Garden** – wrap common mitigation/adaptation models with consistent IO contracts.
3. **Program Ops** – templates for grants, procurement, workforce, and reporting.
4. **Civic UX** – dashboards + notifications for residents and operators.
